CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) is a widely used expert system development tool that provides a framework for building rule-based systems for knowledge representation, inference, and decision-making. It was developed by NASA's Johnson Space Center in the 1980s and has since become an open-source software widely used in various domains for developing expert systems.
CLIPS provides a rule-based programming language that allows developers to create production rules that represent domain-specific knowledge or expertise. These rules consist of condition-action pairs, where conditions specify the patterns to match in the knowledge base, and actions specify the responses or actions to take when a condition is satisfied. CLIPS uses a forward-chaining inference engine, which iteratively applies rules to the available data or facts until no more rules are triggered, and produces the final conclusions or decisions.
